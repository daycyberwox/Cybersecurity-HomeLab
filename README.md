# This Project
This is a instructional step by step process to building a functional **Cybersecurity Homelab** for offensive and defensive security.

The hypervisor for this lab is going to be VMWare Workstation running on a Windows PC.

**PC Parts:** https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xfBQXv

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about Security Monitoring and Detection Engineering. 

This lab consists of:

  ~ **Kali:** This is the offensive machine that will be used to propagate different forms of attacks.
	
  ~ **pfsense:** This will be the firewall for controllin inbound and outbound traffice, only accessible and visible in the VM private network.
	
  ~ **Security Onion:** This will be the all-in-one IDS, Security Monitoring and Log Management solution.
	
  ~ **Splunk:** This is an additional SIEM that will be used in addition and comparison to Kibana on Security Onion.
	
  ~ **Windows DC:** This is a windows domain controller that will have two windows machins connected to it.
	
  ~ **Windows 7 & Windows *XP*:** These windows machine will vary based on individual needs
	
  ~ **Ubuntu/Centos/Metasploitable/DVWA/Vulnhub machines:** All these are potential linux machines that can be added to the network for exploitation, detection, or monitoring purposes
