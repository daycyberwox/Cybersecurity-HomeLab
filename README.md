# Cybersecurity-HomeLab

This is a instructional step by step process to building a functional cybersecurity homelab for offensive and defensive security.

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about Security Monitoring and Detection Engineering. 

This lab consists of:
  ~ Kali: This is the offensive machine that will be used to propagate different forms of attacks.
  ~ pfsense: This will be the firewall for controllin inbound and outbound traffice, only accessible and visible in the VM private network.
  ~ Security Onion: This will be the all-in-one IDS, Security Monitoring and Log Management solution.
  ~ Splunk: This is an additional SIEM that will be used in addition and comparison to Kibana on Security Onion.
  ~ Windows DC: This is a windows domain controller that will have two windows machins connected to it.
  ~ Windows 7 & Windows *XP*: These windows machine will vary based on individual needs
  ~ Ubuntu/Centos/Metasploitable/DVWA/Vulnhub machines: All these are potential linux machines that can be added to the network for exploitation, detection, or monitoring purposes
